You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official [installation link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).\n",

    "In this lab we will find the customers who were active in consecutive months of May and June. Follow the steps to complete the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a table `rentals_may` to store the data from rental table with information for the month of May.\n",
    "- Insert values in the table `rentals_may` using the table rental, filtering values only for the month of May.\n",
    "- Create a table `rentals_june` to store the data from rental table with information for the month of June.\n",
    "- Insert values in the table `rentals_june` using the table rental, filtering values only for the month of June.\n",
    "- Check the number of rentals for each customer for May.\n",
    "- Check the number of rentals for each customer for June.\n",
    "- Create a Python connection with SQL database and retrieve the results of the last two queries (also mentioned below) as dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Check the number of rentals for each customer for May\n",
    "  - Check the number of rentals for each customer for June\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hint**: You can store the results from the two queries in two separate dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function that checks if customer borrowed more or less films in the month of June as compared to May.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Hint**: For this part, you can create a join between the two dataframes created before, using the merge function available for pandas dataframes. Here is a link to the documentation for the [merge function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html).\n"
